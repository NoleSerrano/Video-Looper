Ensure sample rates are consistent for vidoes (pcm.py can be a culprite 44.1 vs 48) and also match channels (stereo or mono?)

Potentially new process
* Run fix_audio.py to reencode the video and get pcm. Also, the audio duration of the video matches the video's duration.
* Then run that processed video file through the reverse2.py, and they will have the same durations

Weird Things
* If you reverse the reversed video in step 2 and put it in Davinci Resolve, it will show that the audio is offset weirdly, however, if you play
  the video you can hear that it's the same
